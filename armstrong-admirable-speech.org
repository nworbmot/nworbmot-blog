C. Darwin: an "admirable speech"

In 1863, William Armstrong advocates:

- end of coal
- efficiency
- electrification
- renewables (he developed first hydro power)
- open data
- technological learning ("tendency of progress is to quicken progress")

And in Henrietta Heald's biography "Magician of the North".

His speech inspired the first suggestion I know of for green hydrogen (renewables + electrolysis of water to make hydrogen): [[./green-hydrogen-history.org][blogpost: History of green hydrogen]].

As well as providing impetus for Jevons' marvellous [[https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/jevons-the-coal-question][The Coal Question]].

There's a fun profile of him and his mansion at Cragside (where he built the first hydroelectric plant to power the lights) in this architectural documentary: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq0ynWjSmTI][Youtube: Jonathan Meades Abroad Again In Britain 04 Cragside House]].

Here's a scan of the speech from the Report of the 33rd Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science:
