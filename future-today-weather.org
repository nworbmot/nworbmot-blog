How does it work?

We take the current day's demand, wind, solar and hydro time series from https://SMARD.de.

[[./graphics/nowcast/dispatch-now.jpeg]]

Then we divide generation by current capacities and scale them up to the future capacities.

[[./graphics/nowcast/future-capacities.jpeg]]

All code and data is open (obvs).

For each day we optimise the feed-in of generation and storage (short-term batteries and long-term hydrogen) with 24 hours of foresight, mimicking the day-ahead market.

Demand here includes today's electricity demand and storage charging. Demand and supply match in each hour.

[[./graphics/nowcast/demand-supply.jpeg]]

We have run this simulation one day at a time with 24 hours foresight over 9 years of data since 2015.

Here are weekly averages where you see more solar + electrolysis in summer, more wind + hydrogen-to-power in winter.

[[./graphics/nowcast/demand-supply-full.jpeg]]

Extra renewable generation is needed to cover the storage losses (batteries have round-trip efficiency of ~90% in the model, hydrogen just 39%). This you can see by the share of each technology in the load.

[[./graphics/nowcast/shares.jpeg]]

Batteries are used to bridge generation gaps of a few hours, while hydrogen bridges multiple days of low wind and solar as well as managing seasonal differences.

[[./graphics/nowcast/dispatch-future.jpeg]]

Hydrogen storage is dispatched on a roughly seasonal basis, filling up in the summer, depleting in the winter.

Note that full power-to-hydrogen-to-power storage systems don't yet exist at scale, and more development is needed for hydrogen turbines to get the NOx emissions down.

[[./graphics/nowcast/h2-soc.jpeg]]

Hydrogen storage is dispatched using a constant hydrogen value of 80 EUR/MWh (LHV). Like how water values are used to dispatch hydroelectricity systems today.

The hydrogen value influences electricity prices when hydrogen turbines supply power, and when electrolysers consume.

[[./graphics/nowcast/prices.jpeg]]

Prices here only drop to zero when supply is larger than all flexible demand. The mean electricity price is 82 ‚Ç¨/MWh, which allows almost all cost recovery of the system cost 93 ‚Ç¨/MWh. Hydrogen turbines don't cover all their investment costs (usual missing money problem).

There are many technical details and warnings on the website:

[[./graphics/nowcast/warnings.jpeg]]

In particular:

- Allowing connection to Germany's neighbours would help balance variations, reducing costs and storage needs
- Including new demands like heat pumps and electric vehicles will raise both total electricity demand and peak demand

We'll add these features soon!
