* Summary

Solar and batteries are cheap enough that most people can get most of
their electricity from them, and save money. This equation gets better
and better over time as their costs decline.

More precisely: solar and batteries can supply 90% of electricity for
80% of the world's population at less than 80 €/MWh (including a fuel
backup) with 2030 assumptions.  Add some wind, existing hydro, or wait
a few more years for costs to decline, and the equation just gets
better.

The map shows the total average system cost of providing electricity
for a constant hourly demand in 2030 with solar and batteries
providing 90% of the electricity and some storeable fuel the final
10%.

For 80% of the population it is below 80 €/MWh. The more expensive
locations are all at high latitudes in the North, where low sunshine
in the winter increases backup costs. In these regions the addition of
wind, existing hydro or other energy sources would help to alleviate
the higher costs.

The graph shows the results for 90%, 95% and 99% solar-battery
supply. The high-latitude regions in particular have difficulty
with the last 1-5% because of low winter sunshine.

With projected cost reductions for solar and batteries in 2050,
80% of the population are below 60 €/MWh for 90% solar-battery
supply, and 93% are below 80 €/MWh for 95% solar-battery supply.

If we add wind in the case of 2030, this helps reduce costs
particularly in high northern latitudes, where the wind tends to blow
more strongly in the winter.

What conclusions can we draw?

- Solar and batteries have the potential to dominate electricity
  supply in most regions of the world, providing cheap and clean power.

- Where there is enough space, this supply can be provided close to
  demand (only minimal grid costs were included in these results).

- The more expensive regions are concentrated at high latitudes in the
  North, where seasonal variations make it attractive to include wind
  and other energy sources.

- We can get far without worrying about the last 5-10%. The solutions
  for the last 5-10% could be fossil fuels in the short-term,
  long-duration storage as it matures, or [[./methanol-faq.html][easily storeable e-biofuels]].


Briefly on the assumptions (more below): The system cost is higher
than the solar levelised cost, because it also includes the costs of
the batteries and backup power, as well as accounting for
curtailment. Utility-scale solar PV and batteries are sized to
minimise the costs for meeting a constant demand based on hourly
weather data from 2011. The 1° by 1° pixels are chosen based on where
the population is densest, representing where 99.9% of the population
lives. The model is based on [[https://model.energy/#background-and-warnings][model.energy]] but without the hydrogen
storage. The most important economic data is based on the [[https://github.com/nworbmot/solar-battery-world/blob/main/defaults.csv][Danish
Energy Agency Technology Database]] for 2030 in 2020 euros: solar
installed cost 384 €/kW_p, battery installed cost 157 €/kWh. By 2050
these reduce to 293 €/kW_p and 83 €/kWh respectively. The solar costs
include 50 €/kW for transformer and grid connection, but no further
grid costs are included.  Additional assumptions: cost of capital 5%,
cost of backup generator with 50% efficiency 1000 €/kW_el, cost of
backup fuel (based roughly on fossil gas) 30 €/MWh_th. There is more
information below including instructions on how to adjust the results
if you don't like the inputs.


* More technical details

The full set of technical assumptions, mostly leaning on the 
[[https://github.com/nworbmot/solar-battery-world/blob/main/defaults.csv][Danish Energy Agency Technology Database]], can be found here:

https://github.com/nworbmot/solar-battery-world/blob/main/defaults.csv

The model is based on [[https://model.energy/#background-and-warnings][model.energy]] but without the hydrogen
storage. It is optimised with free generation for the final 10/5/1%
then the costs are added back on top. This allows the user to easily
increase the investment or fuel cost for the backup, since this is the
most uncertain part of the costing.

For example, if the solar-battery system on its own costs 50 €/MWh for
(100-x)% coverage, where x=10,5,1, then you add for the backup per €/MWh:

investment cost * (annuity factor + FOM) / 8760 + fuel cost * x / efficiency

For the default back investment cost of 1 M€/MW, 25 year lifetime, 5% cost of capital, 3% yearly FOM, fuel cost of 30 €/MWh_th, efficiency 50% you get

1e6 * (0.071 + 0.03) / 8760 + 30*(x/100)/0.5 = (11.5 + 0.6x) €/MWh

For x=10, you get a total 17.5 €/MWh contribution from the backup.

If the fuel cost rises to 50 €/MWh, the backup contribution rises to (11.5 + x) = 21.5 €/MWh.

The sensitivity of the total cost to the fuel cost is directly tied to
x - the more solar and wind, the lower x and the less the fuel
dependency becomes.

To supply the full demand with these assumptions with a fuel cost of
30 €/MWh_th would cost (11.5 + 60) = 71.5 €/MWh, which is more
expensive in most locations that the solar-battery-fuel
system. However the cost of the backup fuel will vary by location
based on availability.

The calculations are carried out for the 9196 1° by 1° pixels that
contains more than 10,000 people, which is enough to include 99.86% of
the population.

The setup is somewhat similar to a [[https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/solar-electricity-every-hour-of-every-day-is-here-and-it-changes-everything/][2025 Ember report]], but whereas they
fixed the solar and battery capacities relative to a constant demand,
and varied the location, we fix instead the fraction of load supplied,
and optimise the solar and battery capacities.

* Warnings

Many of the [[https://model.energy/#background-and-warnings][model.energy]] warnings also apply here.

- The demand is flat, so doesn't account for seasonal variability in
  demand. Cooling demand align well with solar insolation. However,
  seasonal heating demands can be a challenge for solar-based
  systems. For high latitudes in the North, the wind is stronger in
  the winter, which raises the value of including wind.
- The more technologies we include, the cheaper the supply cost can
  become. In particular more storage technologies, wind, existing
  hydro and other low-carbon sources can decrease costs while keeping
  emissions low.
- The results are quite sensitive to battery costs, so further cost
  reductions here could bring the system costs down further.
- Including demand response, such as from battery electric vehicles,
  can further reduce costs.
- Connecting regions can also spread balancing costs, particularly for
  wind-heavy systems, at the expense of building the necessary grid
  infrastructure.
- General grid costs were not included here beyond 50 €/kW to connect
  the solar, because in principle these utility-scale systems could be
  implemented locally if there is space, and distribution costs will
  vary from region to region.
- The solar panels have a fixed tilt of 35 degrees towards the
  equator. Axis-tracking could lower costs.
- The cost assumptions assume utility-scale solar panels and batteries
  in large parks. Smaller-scale rooftop solar and home batteries would
  cost 2-3 times more.
- There may not be sufficient land near densely-populated areas. This
  may require supply from further away. More discussion on land use
  can be found below.
- The cost of capital, assumed to be 5%, may be higher in some regions.
- The solar insolation is based on reanalysis data from the European
  Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels][ERA5dataset]] and is
  processed using the [[https://github.com/FRESNA/atlite][atlite library]]. Reanalysis data is sometimes
  imperfect.

* Open code and data

All code and data on which these calculations are based are available
with an open licence:

https://github.com/nworbmot/solar-battery-world

* Land and material use

Some rough calculations are provided here.

Assuming most energy demand electrifies and living standards equalise worldwide, each person would consume annually around 10 MWh_el/a/person.

This gives worldwide electricity demand for 8 billion people of 80,000 TWh_el/a.

The 90% solar-battery supply would require then 69 TW_p of solar and 72 TWh of batteries in 2050.

70 TW_p at 50 MW_p/km2 covers 1,400,000 km2, around 1% of total land and 3.7% of land used for livestock:

[[./graphics/solar-battery-world/Global-land-use-breakdown.png]]

But **locally** in densely-populated areas there may not be sufficient land, requiring the grid to transport it from neighbouring regions.
