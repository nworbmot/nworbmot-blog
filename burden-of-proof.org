* About this document

This blog post is a personal viewpoint by Tom Brown. It does not represent the viewpoint of my employer, KIT. It does not necessarily represent the viewpoint of the co-authors of [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.113][our recent paper]], but I have asked them for feedback. It is not a consensus viewpoint of those who support renewable energy.

It was written quickly, so it may contain mistakes and faulty arguments. I don't have a synoptic view of the literature, so it may not contain the best arguments. For this reason, I'll be updating the document over time. You can see the changes between versions in the [[https://github.com/nworbmot/nworbmot-blog][github repository]].

It is intended for a lay audience, so please don't complain that I'm over-explaining everything.

* Background

In April 2017 an article [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.114][Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of
the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems]] (henceforth just
"Burden") appeared that claimed 100% renewable energy studies don't
demonstrate sufficient feasibility. My co-authors and I answered the
points raised in May 2018 in a [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.113][response article]]. Since then various
counter-arguments appeared online, on Twitter and in blogs. Here I
intend to collect responses to all these points, as well as developing
a few other themes. Initially I'll focus on the points raised by Ben
Heard, the lead author of Burden, but also address other points. Ben
has kindly given me permission to quote his tweets and has checked
that my representation of his points is correct.

** How to read our response article and this blog post

To understand the case for 100% renewable energy systems, our [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.113][response
article]] has to be read with the accompanying references. First of all,
it relies on the many existing 100% studies already in the literature
that were listed in the article. These studies propose investments in
the energy system (generators, power lines, storage, etc.) that
guarantee that energy demand can be met at all times and in all places
under many different weather and demand conditions. The Burden paper
questioned the assumptions and methodology behind these studies, and
it was to these points we replied, using examples and references from
the engineering and modelling literature.

This blog post can be read as a companion to our response article,
fleshing out some points with more explanation.

* Generalities

** Where we agree and disagree

Here's where I think the different sides of this argument agree and disagree, although obviously I can't claim to speak for anyone but myself:

We all agree global warming is an urgent issue.

We all agree that man-made carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to global warming and should be reduced as soon as possible.

Most of us agree that it is possible to reduce man-made carbon dioxide emissions in time to avoid the worst effects of global warming, if we act fast enough.

We are disagreeing about the technologies that should be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

It's possible to disagree because technologies are always in a state
of flux, some getting cheaper, some getting more expensive, and new
technologies are also coming onto the market. Different people
have different views on which technologies will prevail. There are
also social, political and environmental risks that
are subject to interpretation and judgement. There are also
engineering judgements: Is a technology safe? Is a problem a
roadblock or just a bread-and-butter engineering challenge?

** Why it's important

You might take the attitude that we should just put a high price on carbon dioxide and let the free market decide. Pricing carbon dioxide and other GHG is an essential prerequisite to effective action on global warming, but it's not the end of the story: there is a miriad of other government policies that play a role (setting market conditions, regulation, taxes, subsidies, R&D spending, strike prices, state loans, implicit state guarantees etc.). These are determined by our view of the technology landscape.


** Where renewables are similar to nuclear

I'll focus for most of the post on renewables and nuclear power; I'll
get back to fossil+CCS another time.

Besides both having low carbon dioxide emissions, renewables and
nuclear are similar from an economic point of view: they both have
high capital costs and low-to-vanishing variable costs. This makes the
levelised cost of energy of both very sensitive to the cost of
capital. So if, for example, you're going to [[http://energypost.eu/putting-nuclear-energy-on-the-critical-path/][argue for lower financing costs for
nuclear]], then for a fair comparison you have to extend the same
benefits to renewables.

Both renewables and nuclear will also require similar solutions
for meeting demand in energy sectors other than electricity.

** Electrification of transport, thermal and industrial demand

France covers 75% of its electricity with nuclear power. Many
countries cover their electricity with hydro power. Denmark has
reached 60% renewable electricity mostly with wind (50% of
electricity) and biomass.

But electricity is just a small fraction of the story. Here are the
carbon dioxide emission in the European Union in 2015:

#+CAPTION: Carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union in 2015 (Source: Tom Brown, based on statistics from [[https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/national-emissions-reported-to-the-unfccc-and-to-the-eu-greenhouse-gas-monitoring-mechanism-13][EEA]])
#+NAME: fig:eu_co2
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
[[./graphics/EU28-emissions_pie-2015-CO2.png]]

No country is yet making big inroads into defossilising transport,
heating and non-electric industrial demand. [One exception is Norway,
which uses electricity from hydro for 75% of its residential space
heating, and is rapidly expanding its use of electric vehicles.] We
need to stop modelling electricity on its own and ignoring the other
sectors, not just because they represent the majority of emissions,
but also because the dynamics of the energy system are totally
different when we consider them.


Whether renewables or nuclear or both, many of the solutions will look
similar. They will all involve some amount of electrification and some
amount of storage, be it electrical, thermal or chemical, with
fossil-free electricity as the proximate energy source.  If you like:
electricity is the new primary energy.


Take transport: We need dense energy carriers for vehicles that don't
lead to GHG emissions. Current options include direct electrification
(think train pantograph), battery electric vehicles, or electrofuels
produced with fossil-free electricity (i.e. electrolysed hydrogen,
methane produced from hydrogen and carbon oxides, methanol, DME,
ammonia, diesel or kerosene from Fischer-Tropsch). Electric vehicles
use electricity more efficiently than electrofuels, and will be fine
on land (even perhaps for heavy-duty vehicles), but aviation and
long-distance shipping are almost certainly going to need
electrofuels.

Take heating: Compare the yearly profile for electricity consumption
in Europe:

with the yearly profile for space and water heating:

#+NAME: fig:heat
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
[[./graphics/heat_demand.png]]


The heating peak is massively more peaked than the electricity
demand. Similar peaks can be seen in other parts of the world with
seasonal heating and/or cooling demand.  How are you going to meet
that peak with a baseload plant?

With electricity as source, the options for heating are: resistive
heating (horribly inefficient), heat pumps (more efficient, with
coefficients of performance (COP) of up to 4-5 for ground-sourced heat
pumps, but they still cause an electricity peak), seasonal thermal
energy storage (e.g. large water tanks in district heating networks,
charged in the summer), or using synthetic electrofuels, also produced
during the summer. (Non-electric sources include solar thermal
collectors and sustainable biomass; you could also use your nuclear
plant as a CHP, but they're located far from population centres, so
there would be big heat losses.) You can also reduce the heating peak
relative to the electricity peak by a massive program of building
insulation. But I don't see any economic ways of meeting that peak
without thermal storage, electrofuels or biofuels.

My point: outside of electricity demand, there is no good way around
the use of electrical storage (e.g. for cars), thermal storage and/or
chemical storage in electrofuels. Second generation biofuels from
waste/agricultural residues will also play a role.

These solutions will be common, regardless of where the fossil-free
electricity comes from.

Two of the authors of Burden (Brook and Wigley) co-authored another
paper [[https://doi.org/10.3390/su10020302][Silver Buckshot or Bullet: Is a Future "Energy Mix" Necessary?]]
where they argue that all energy demand should be met by the nuclear
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor][Integral Fast Reactor (IFR)]], and their solution is similar to that
described above: "Given that peak demand is typically two to three
times greater than average demand ... IFR technology can produce what
is essentially 'free' excess energy, which could be used to produce
hydrogen" and then further used for other synthetic fuels (page
6). Except for some reason they deny this possibility to renewables,
arguing on page 4 that their excess energy has to be "dumped" - a
strange double standard.

Either way, the huge potential variability on the demand side from
shiftable battery electric vehicle charging and hydrogen electrolysis
means that it matters less whether you have dispatchable nuclear or
variable renewables on the supply side. It will increasingly come down
to the cost of energy. I'll return to this point in future posts.


** Scaleability, mass production and substitution

One of the chief advantages of renewable generators has been their
small unit size (solar panels in kW's, wind turbines in single-digit
MW's), which has enabled fast deployment, mass production and learning
effects that have brought down costs dramatically.  Similar effects
are now driving down the cost of lithium-ion batteries.  These effects
have not yet been leveraged by nuclear technologies (smaller
modular reactors could be commercialised, but [[http://energypost.eu/small-modular-reactors-for-nuclear-power-hope-or-mirage/][some are sceptical]]).

Substitution: Renewables and the flexibility options required to
integrate them are not a single technology; there are many different
technology combinations that can be substituted if one is not
viable. There are system concepts with more transmission and wind
(i.e. more centralised); concepts with more solar and storage
(i.e. more localised); and everything inbetween (see for example [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.004][our
recent paper]] on this point). Concentrated solar power with thermal
storage in regions with high direct irradation performs similarly in
the system to solar PV and battery systems. For any given storage
technology, there are substitutes with similar power and energy
characteristics (see below). Battery electric vehicles can be
substituted with fuel cell vehicles, vehicles combusting hydrogen
directly, or, less efficiently, vehicles running on liquid
electrofuels. Whatever the most cost-effective technology is, there
are plenty of feasible alternatives.


* Storage technologies

A few people complained that the storage section in our review paper
was too brief and relied too much on references (perhaps they should
just read the references?), so here's a slightly expanded version.


** Electricity storage

Three points here:

i) If you just focus on electricity provision, ignoring other sectors,
there is no strict necessity for stationary electricity storage in
highly renewable scenarios.

One of the first decent 100% renewable electricity scenarios was
presented in 2005 by Gregor Czisch in his [[https://kobra.bibliothek.uni-kassel.de/bitstream/urn:nbn:de:hebis:34-200604119596/1/DissVersion0502.pdf][doctoral thesis]] (in German). He showed a combination of wind, existing hydro and 20%
biomass (within the range of sustainable waste and residue biomass),
along with substantial transmission expansion, could cover all
electricity demand in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Neither
storage was built nor any photovoltaics. [Archaeological note: he had
assumed a capital cost of 5500 EUR/kW for PV in 2050; the current
price is less than a sixth of that and hurtling towards a tenth soon.]

In a [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09711][preprint]] (not yet through peer review) we showed recently it is
possible to get to 99.9% renewable electricity in Europe without
biomass or storage, i.e. with only transmission and existing hydro for
flexibility, although this pushes up the cost substantially. The
availability of storage makes the system cheaper.

At the moment, solar and battery systems are looking very attractive,
but if lithium has to be prioritised in electric vehicles, there are
many other alternatives to lithium batteries.

ii) There is more to stationary electricity storage than lithium batteries. Here is a chart of different technologies from the 2014 paper [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.081][Overview of current development in electrical energy storage technologies and the application potential in power system operation]] we cited in our review:

#+CAPTION: Comparison of power rating and rated energy capacity with discharge time duration at power rating (Source: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.081)
#+NAME: fig:storage
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
[[./graphics/storage.jpg]]

Not all the technologies are mature. Here is a list with commentary on
maturity from that paper:

Of the short-term storage technologies useful for balancing solar
there is: pumped hydro ("mature", but viability depends on geography
and environmental impact analysis); lithium ion (li-ion,
"demonstration" as of 2014, but now commercialised); compressed air
energy storage (CAES, "commercialised"); adiabatic CAES
("developing"); lead-acid ("mature"); sodium-sulphur batteries (NaS,
"commercialised"); vanadium redox flow battery (VRB, "demo/early
commercialised"); polysulfide bromine flow battery (PSB,
"developing"); zinc bromide flow battery (ZnBr, "demonstration");
nickel–cadmium (NiCd, "commercialised").

Of the longer-term storage technologies useful for balancing wind there is:
compressed air energy storage (CAES, "commercialised"); adiabatic CAES
("developing"); thermal energy storage (TES, "demo/early
commercialised", although I would classify it as
"commercialised" for 2018); hydrogen storage ("developing/demonstration");
other synthetic electrofuel storage.

Storing thermal energy is as simple as taking a large tank of hot
water and insulating it; this is already done at scale in district
heating networks. Converting it back to electricity is inefficient and
the thermal energy is better used directly in the heating sector. TES
can also be done with other mediums, like hot rocks or ceramics.

Using electricity to electrolyse water will be discussed in more
detail in the following section on electrofuels.


iii) In sector-coupled scenarios, many studies don't see any need for
stationary electricity storage at all. To quote from our paper, "in a
holistic, cross-sectoral energy systems approach that goes beyond
electricity to integrate all thermal, transport and industrial demand,
it is possible to identify renewable energy systems in which all
storage is based on low-cost well-proven technologies, such as
thermal, gas and liquid storage, all of which are cheaper than
electricity storage ([[https://doi.org/10.5278/ijsepm.2016.11.2][190]])". This connects to point i) above and the
discussion on sector-coupling. A lack of stationary electricity
storage is not a deal-breaker for 100% renewables systems.

** On lithium and rare earth restrictions

On the resources front, concerns about renewables scenarios are most
often raised for lithium and rare earth metals.

Lithium and rare earth restrictions are, however, primarily a problem
for battery electric vehicles, not for renewables; therefore this
problem affects all fossil-free scenarios.

As far as rare earth requirements for wind turbines go, several
major manufacturers (e.g. Enercon, Siemens) build wind turbines with
electromagnets (copper and steel) rather than permanent magnets, which
do not need rare earths, see for example the 2017 paper
[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420717300077][Substitution
strategies for reducing the use of rare earths in wind turbines]].

As explained above, stationary lithium batteries are not a strict
requirement for renewables systems, but currently they look
economically attractive combined with PV and may compete in the future
for lithium with BEVs.

For electric vehicle motors there are alternative concepts that use
less rare earth metals, see the 2017 paper [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2017.01.003][Role of substitution in
mitigating the supply pressure of rare earths in electric road
transport applications]]. There is no clear winner and it seems R&D is
still required in this area.

Lithium is less problematic. According to the [[https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/][United States Geological
Survey]] in 2018 total worldwide lithium reserves were 16 million tLi,
and identified resources (the same category we use for uranium below)
were 53 million tLi. These figures are "metric tons of lithium
content"; lithium resources are also often quoted in mass of Lithium
Carbonate Equivalent (LCE); lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) contains around
18.8% lithium, see also this [[http://rocktechlithium.com/lithium-conversion-table/][lithium conversion table]]. Mine production
was 43,000 tLi in 2017 according to the USGS, or 230,000 tLCE.

A common assumption is that 1 kWh of battery capacity requires 1
kgLCE, so if a typical car has a 50 kWh battery, that's around 10 kgLi.

So the identified resources are enough to cover 5.3 billion cars.

Today there are around 1 billion cars, so there is enough to cover a
significant growth in demand; if no new resources are identified, or
new resources are too expensive, recycling of lithium is also possible.

There's also all sorts of [[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.7b05874][interesting ways]] to increase the energy
density of lithium ion batteries without using more lithium.

Cobalt scarcity could be a problem for BEV batteries, given that
much of it is mined in the Republic of Congo. It would be interesting
to understand the alternatives here.

As mentioned above under "substitution", there are several
alternatives to BEVs for fossil-free transport, in the unlikely event
that resource restrictions make BEVs unviable.



** Synthetic electrofuels

Here we use "electrofuels" to refer to chemicals produced with
electricity. Whether in gaseous or liquid form, these chemicals can be
stored cheaply for long periods of time; many can use existing
distribution and storage infrastructure currently used for fossil
fuels.  The downside of their use is energy conversion losses that
have to be offset against their versatility.

The first step in their production is typically the electrolysis of
hydrogen. Hydrogen can be used as-is, or combined with a carbon source
to make methane, other hydrocarbons (e.g. diesel, kerosene), DME,
methanol, etc., or combined with nitrogen to make ammonia. Hydrogen
can also be produced thermochemically, using either solar or nuclear
energy.

As far as the production of hydrocarbons from hydrogen and carbon
oxides goes, many of the chemical processes are already done today on
an industrial scale, such as methanation, used on syngas from the
gasification of coal to create [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_natural_gas][synthetic natural gas]] (SNG), or the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process][Fischer-Tropsch process]] to create liquid hydrocarbons from
syngas. These are mature technologies and there are no resource
restrictions here.

What is currently not done on a large scale is the first step, the
electrolysis of hydrogen. This is for economic reasons: steam
reformation of natural methane is cheaper and is used for 95% of the
world's hydrogen production, even though it results in direct carbon
dioxide emissions.

There are three technologies for electrolysis: Alkaline, Proton
Exchange Membrane (PEM) and Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC); the
different advantages and disadvantages are discussed for example in
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.07.066][this paper]] and [[https://www.di-verlag.de/media/content/GFE/issue_2_14/gfe2_14_fb_Grond.pdf][this report]]. Both Alkaline and PEM are commercialised
(Siemens is already selling its [[https://www.siemens.com/global/de/home/produkte/energie/erneuerbare-energien/hydrogen-solutions.html][SILYZER]] range of PEM electrolysers in
the megawatt range); SOEC has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level][Technology Readiness Level]] (TRL) 6-7
according to [[https://dechema.de/dechema_media/Technology_study_Low_carbon_energy_and_feedstock_for_the_European_chemical_industry-p-20002750.pdf][this report]] (TRL goes from 1 ("basic principles observed
and reported") up to 9 ("proven through successful mission
operations")). Alkaline is the current state-of-the-art for
electrolytic hydrogen production, but PEM and SOEC show the greatest
promise for cost reduction. PEM is reliant on scarce platinum;
technology developments will lower platinum usage, and platinum can be
recycled, but this restriction may favour SOEC in the long
run. Whichever way it goes, there are several options for
electrolysis, it is just not clear which will win the cost reduction
battle.




* Renewables

** Grid costs with renewables

Ben [[https://twitter.com/BNW_Ben/status/999464491761848321][questioned]] how we could be so sanguine in our review about
additional grid costs corresponding to 10-15% of total system costs.

The point here is simple: additional grid expansion enables cost
savings elsewhere on generation and storage. If you can use the grid
to integrate wind and solar generators at sites with the best
resources, or if you can use grids to smooth out renewable feed-in
over a large area and reduce the need for balancing services, you'll
end up saving more than you spend on the grid. This is, after all, the
criterion for efficient grid investment: you keep building until
the marginal benefit of new capacity is zero.

Here's a concrete example from the [[https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/][Ten Year Network Development Plan]]
(TYNDP) of the European Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) which
we quoted in our paper: they foresee 150 billion EUR investment needs
in the European transmission system in total, of which 70-80 billion
EUR by 2030, resulting in 1 to 2 EUR/MWh grid costs, but enabling 1.5
to 5 EUR/MWh reduction in wholesale prices through the integration of
cheaper generation sources (renewables *and* nuclear). Grid expansion
costs pay off elsewhere in the system.

In another report by ENTSO-E on the [[https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/tyndp2018/power-system-2040/][European Power System in 2040]] they
calculate that the extra costs to consumers of *not* extending the grid
would run to 43 billion EUR per year. Extending the grid leads to
cheaper overall system costs; grid costs increase, but costs elsewhere
in the system go down by more.

This is part of a general theme: with the costs of renewable energy
production already below conventional sources and sinking every year,
a greater fraction of system costs is going to energy integration.

As we explained in Chapter 4.4 of our paper, overhead power lines can
be controversial; there are other options (underground cables,
storage) if public acceptance is lacking, but they are more expensive.


** Renewable fluctuations balancing out

Ben [[https://twitter.com/BNW_Ben/status/999462190955425793][quoted]] from our paper "However, the time resolution depends on the
area under consideration, since short-term weather fluctuations are
not correlated over large distances and therefore balance out" and
he doubted this was true: "Can show 2 weeks of Australia getting ~0
supply from wind/solar".

This is a misunderstanding, which can be resolved by reading further
in the paper. We're saying that the variations in production values over
short time scales are not correlated over large distances, but the
production values themselves are definitely correlated (see references
in footnote 3).

Perhaps it's easier to say this in mathematics: suppose we have
production $p_{n,t}$ at location $n$ and time $t$. The production time
series for different $n$ will be correlated over hundreds of
kilometres for both solar and wind. However, the differences
$\Delta_{n,t} = p_{n,t} - p_{n,t-1}$ will not be correlated for short
time steps beyond 100 km (see Figure 2 in our paper).

So what we said is consistent with wind/solar dropping to zero for 2
weeks in Australia.


** Temporal scales at fine spatial resolution

Christopher Clack [[https://twitter.com/clacky007/status/999479315602460672][raised the point]] that sub-hourly variations, which
we said were less important at national level, play a bigger role at
smaller spatial scales.

This is true; after all Burden's source (123) for the sub-hourly
variations of PV was based on a single solar power plant.

Our argument was that over larger distances, sub-hourly variations are
not correlated and therefore smooth out.

However, even if there is no problem over the larger area, there may
be local variations that locally stress the grid. For example, there
could be correlated variations between substations in the grid that
cause power fluctuations within the transmission grid in each country.

The answer to this is quite simple: if this is a problem, it is
already being managed successfully today. Variable renewable feed-in
already approaches 100% instantaneous penetration in Germany, and
exceeds 100% in Denmark. If this were a show-stopper, we'd know
already. Still, I'd be curious to learn from TSOs whether this is
something they have to actively manage, and whether they see
e.g. 5-minute fluctuations due to renewables in their grids, and
whether these fluctuations on short time scales are any worse than
those from the load.





** Energy use for manufacturing energy converters

The issue was raised in a private email that in Section 3.1 on energy
consumption we took account of switching fuels (Figure 1) and
mining/refining upstream costs of fossil fuels and uranium, but not of
the energy used to manufacture generators, vehicles and heating units.

For the energy used to manufacture generators, consider this
graph from [[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-017-0032-9][this 2017 paper]] in Nature Energy, which considers indirect
"embodied energy use" (EEU), defined as the energy required for the
construction of power plants and the production and transportation of
fuels and other inputs:


#+CAPTION: Embodied energy use of electricity generation technologies as a percentage of lifetime electricity generation (Source: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-017-0032-9)
#+NAME: fig:embodied
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
[[./graphics/embodied_energy.png]]

The embodied energy use of wind, CSP and PV (primarily in
construction) is much smaller than fossil, hydro or bioenergy
sources. Nuclear is also much lower (due to the energy density of
uranium, which requires less mining and refining than fossil fuels per
MWh).

Just as important as the energy use is the CO2 impact, i.e. how much of this energy use can be done without CO2 emissions. Electricity can be
defossilised; liquid energy carriers are presumably in transport and
can also be electrified or substituted for electrofuels; gas can also
be synthesised; process heat from solid fuels must also be substituted.

For battery electric vehicles, the energy used in construction,
particularly of the batteries, can be up to double internal combustion
engine vehicles doi:10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x, so this does
compensate somewhat for the primary energy saved in switching
fuels. It would be interesting to understand which parts of the
production process can be easily substituted with fossil-free electricity.

For heat pumps I'm still looking for a reference.



** All 100% is hydro

Ben [[https://twitter.com/BNW_Ben/status/999467691122438144][tweeted]] "Brown et al's list of places that are 'close to' 100 % RE
is basically hydro, hydro, hydro. And many studies in Burden of Proof
needed +++ hydro. We discussed why this is and can be a serious
sustainability problem."

We acknowledged that the examples were mostly hydro in the following
paragraph. We were also not advocating the expansion of hydro. Most
studies rely on the expansion of wind and solar generators.

* Nuclear

** Existing plants

The concern was [[https://twitter.com/jmkorhonen/status/997348827265892353][raised]] that the arguments in our article might be used
to advocate shutting existing nuclear plants. I share this
concern. While I respect the public consensus on this issue in some
countries, I think it's a mistake to prematurely close existing plants
as long as they can be safely operated (which includes an ongoing
assessment of the terrorism threat), and as long as any subsidy they
require to stay open cannot be more cost-effectively spent on
renewable generation. This has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

** Uranium resources

For uranium resources we took in our response article the biggest
number we consider reliable from the NEA and IAEA's report [[https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2016/7301-uranium-2016.pdf][Uranium
2016: Resources, Production and Demand]] (the 'Red Book'), which is the
total identified resources in the highest cost category (<USD
260/kgU), amounting to 7.6 million tU. This includes both 'reasonable
assured resources' and 'inferred resources'. We pointed out that in a
scenario fully relying on nuclear power from once-through light-water
reactors, these resources could cover the world's current electricity
demand for only around 13 years, and the world's full energy demand
for just 6 years. Our point was that a fully nuclear world based on
light-water reactors would soon be relying on 'undiscovered resources'
(divided into 'prognosticated' and 'speculative' according to the Red
Book) or 'unconventional resources', or would have to trade up to
reactors that use uranium (and other actinides) more efficiently, like
fast reactors.  At much lower usage rates of uranium, like today's,
there's clearly no problem for many decades. In a mixed
renewables-nuclear scenario with a significant share of nuclear much
higher than today's, the problem is just deferred.

The [[https://twitter.com/BNW_Ben/status/999470345890353152][counter-point]] was made by Ben: "Both what is identified and what
is recoverable is totally price dependent, and the price of the ore
has near-zero impact on the price of the electricity", i.e. if uranium
becomes scarce, the price will go up and stimulate new exploration.

The Red Book estimates undiscovered resources to be 7.4 million tU
(although reporting is incomplete, excluding possible "significant
resource potential in as yet sparsely explored areas" in
Australia). It notes that "Both prognosticated and speculative
resources require significant amounts of exploration before their
existence can be confirmed and grades and tonnages can be defined". So
both the price and volume is uncertain.

On "unconventional resources", the Red Book has this to say: "Most of
the unconventional uranium resources reported to date are associated
with uranium in phosphate rocks, but other potential sources exist
(e.g. black shale and seawater)." On uranium from phosphates "22
million tU...is probably a very conservative estimate of total
resources but is likely to be a reasonably accurate reflection of
commercially exploitable resources". Seawater resources are "over 4
billion tU" but due to low concentrations "developing a cost-effective
method of extraction remains a challenge". A possible development (not
tested at scale) that brings the price of extraction down to 660
USD/kgU is mentioned.

Let's take that last price. At today's uranium prices (around 50
USD/kgU), the fuel cost is pretty trivial. But at 660 USD/kgU,
assuming that's a reliable figure, it's contributing 16.5 USD/MWh
(assuming 40 MWh/kgU), which will have a non-trivial impact on
economic viability (see section below).

As for the rest, there seems to be a high level of uncertainty, both
on volume and price. Even taking the best of reported 'undiscovered
resources' and unconventional commercially exploitable uranium for
phosphates, we get an extra 29 million tU, which buys the total energy
system with once-through light-water reactors another 24 years.

We need an energy source that can provide energy for hundreds of
years. Renewables fulfil that condition (material constraints for
renewables and storage are discussed above). Fast reactors fulfil that
condition.

Consider the section on uranium resources on pages 327-8 in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13393683-plentiful-energy][Plentiful
Energy]], the story of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor][Integral Fast Reactor (IFR)]] as told by
Charles Till and Yoon Chang. Charles Till was the lead of the IFR
project and Yoon Chang was his deputy. They show that "IFR deployment
can cap the cumulative uranium requirements just above the 'Identified
Resources' [for them about 7 million tU] and 'Undiscovered Resources'
[for them about 10 million tU] combined". They go on to say
"Undiscovered Resources refers to uranium that is thought to exist on
the basis of indirect evidence and geological extrapolation. The
existence, size, and recovery cost of such resources are
speculative. In fact, it is reasonable to suggest that amounts only up
to the limits of Identified Resources category should be taken as the
limit of uranium resources at any given time, because commitments to
build nuclear capacity must be made on the basis of confidence in the
availability of uranium resources over their entire
lifetimes". Agreed. [NB: Plentiful Energy
has a Foreword by Barry Brook, a co-author of Burden.]


For me the two consistent positions you can take on this are:

i) We have the resources for a moderate use of light-water reactors for many decades

ii) For a full switch to nuclear, light-water reactors can only be a bridge of a few decades before fast nuclear reactors become desirable

Position i) is fine, but I'd question the economics, see below; it
will still require relying on renewables for the rest of the
fossil-free energy.

Position ii) is put by Plentiful Energy (and without so much bridge by
Silver Bullet), also for other reasons like waste management, lower
proliferation risk and safety, but I'd question both the risk of
relying on unproven technology and the economics (estimates put the
cost of fast reactors at 25% more than light-water reactors, but they haven't
been tested commercially).


** Fast reactors

We were careful not to foreclose on either fast reactors or fusion; we
just don't think they're mature enough to rely on for future planning.
I appreciate some of the arguments for the IFR and it sounds like it
was a mistake to cancel the project before it was fully
demonstrated. If the technology is further developed, I'll be watching
with interest, but remain sceptical on cost.

** Mixing nuclear and renewables

In response to the assertion in our paper that renewables and nuclear
don't mix well, Ben [[https://twitter.com/BNW_Ben/status/999470779417804801][tweeted]] "Well that's just wrong, see recent paper
from @JesseJenkins . my own upcoming modelling of the NEM finds great
combinations of wind, solar, hydro, nuclear + open cycle gas.".

Everything that needs to be said on this topic was already said in
[[https://twitter.com/nworbmot/status/997810157735366657][this thread]]. Jesse Jenkins and colleagues' [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.002][paper]] assumes fixed
capacities of renewables and nuclear, and then examines how they can
be operated together in an efficient way (i.e. it's a short-run
dispatch model). This is a different question to what the optimal
capacities are.

In our paper we were making a point about long-run investment,
i.e. that when deciding how much capacity to build, the case for mixed
renewable-nuclear systems is weak. If nuclear plants are not
cost-effective today running as baseload, they are even less likely to
be cost-effective when running at part-load to balance renewables. This is
the same argument why no country is 100% nuclear today: a baseload
profile does not fit the varying demand profile, so e.g. in France
there is only 75% nuclear coverage, with the majority of nuclear plant
as baseload, some doing some load-following, and flexible generation
and storage providing the rest of electricity generation.

The one potential hole in this argument is that high market prices
during times of variable renewable scarcity might provide enough
revenue for nuclear operators to cover their fixed costs. However,
nuclear is then in competition with existing hydro, imports,
sustainable biomass, DSM and storage during these hours.  This
question can only be resolved by simulation (I might provide some toy
examples in [[https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA][PyPSA]] later) and the question essentially boils down to
what your cost assumptions are for renewables, storage and nuclear
(see next subsection).

Since most 100% renewable electricity simulations already show total
system costs (including balancing by transmission and storage) in the
range 50-60 EUR/MWh, this is the cost with which nuclear has to
compete. Unless nuclear is in this range, it will be excluded from
investment simulations.


** The cost of electricity from light-water reactors

Let's talk about the new nuclear power plant under construction at
Hinkley Point in Britain. Not because it's very expensive, but because
it is being financed under similar conditions to new renewable power
plants. (I accept that restarting a nuclear programme with a new type
of reactor design is going to be more expensive than large-scale
deployment of an established design.)

In the UK, new renewable plant as well as new nuclear receive a strike
price, which is a guaranteed price for their energy, up to which money
is topped if the market price is below the strike price. This gives
investors some degree of certainty.

Hinkley Point C is (I think) the first case where a nuclear power
plant has been financed under such an arrangement.  It means that the
project developer has to bear all the risk in case of budget
overruns. They also have to set aside 7.3 billion pounds (GBP) in 2016
prices for decommissioning and waste management. If the costs go above
this level, as with the costs of dealing with any major accident, the
state still has to foot the bill. You can read more about the Hinkley
Point deal, along with a breakdown of costs (see Figure 2) and the
burden to consumers in the UK National Audit Office's [[https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Hinkley-Point-C.pdf][report on
Hinkley Point C]].

The strike price for Hinkley Point C was fixed at 92.5 GBP/MWh at 2012
prices, index linked after that. That means it's hit over 100 GBP/MWh
at today's prices, or around 120 EUR/MWh. The Department for Business,
Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) [[https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-auction-offshore-wind-cheaper-than-new-gas][expects]] wholesale power prices
to average 53 GBP/MWh in the period from 2023 to 2035.  Compare this
to other recent auction results: 57.5 GBP/MWh for offshore wind in GB
in 2017 (including the grid connection), 29 USD/MWh for solar PV in
Chile and 30 USD/MWh for onshore wind in Morocco, see the following
graphic:

Lazard's 2017 [[https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/][Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) analysis]] puts utility PV
(43-52 USD/MWh) and onshore wind (30-60 USD/MWh) well under half the
cost of nuclear (112-183 USD/MWh).


These auction and LCOE results are just for the energy generated by
renewables and do not include the integration costs for both nuclear
and renewables (e.g. balancing services, flexibility, storage and
networks). That's why researchers do system integration studies to
work out the full cost of all technologies playing together to meet
energy demand in all weather and load situations.  But even factoring
in these integration costs, average global electricity costs are
simulated to drop from 70 EUR/MWh in 2015 to as low as 52 EUR/MWh for
100% renewable energy in 2050 according to [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pip.2950][this paper]]. The many other
studies we cited in our paper show similar results.

New nuclear will have to compete with these total system costs, and
[[http://energypost.eu/putting-nuclear-energy-on-the-critical-path/][currently it doesn't]] in many countries. Some of the costs reported in
South Korea and China for nuclear approach these levels, but there are
reasons to treat these numbers with scepticism. The suspicion has been
raised in a [[https://www.greenpeace.de/sites/www.greenpeace.de/files/publications/20170705_greenpeace_studie_comparing_electricity_costs_engl.pdf][report for Greenpeace]] (page 53), based on the prices of
the same power plants built for the export market, that in China and
South Korea "a high level of domestic subsidy [is] possibly
incorporated in the reported overnight costs that are commonly used in
international publications". [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.052][Other]] [[http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/66334/][concerns]] have been raised in the
academic literature that analysis of nuclear overnight costs does not
reflect the substantial effects of construction delays and cost
overruns.

According to the [[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf][IPCC 5th Assessment Report on Mitigating Climate
Change in Energy]] "Potential project and financial risks are
illustrated by the significant time and cost over-runs of the two
novel European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) in Finland and France
(Kessides, 2012). Without support from governments, investments in new
nuclear power plants are currently generally not economically
attractive within liberalized markets".


So, to be convincing on cost, let's see nuclear competing with
renewables in auctions under similar conditions, i.e. project
developers bearing construction risks, financing done at market rates,
and a transparent, sufficient contribution made to decommissioning and
waste management.


** Concerns about nuclear generation beyond cost

As the [[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf][IPCC 5th Assessment Report on Mitigating Climate Change in
Energy]] summarises it: "Barriers to and risks associated with an increasing
use of nuclear energy include operational risks and the associated
safety concerns, uranium mining risks, financial and regulatory risks,
unresolved waste management issues, nuclear weapon proliferation
concerns, and adverse public opinion (robust evidence, high
agreement)."

Another issue, discussed above in the section on scaleability, is the
speed with which plants can be built. We need to reduce emissions
urgently throughout the 2020s to comply with the Paris accords. Given
the size and complexity of nuclear plants, there is a long lead time
between planning and operation (10-19 years), whereas smaller, simpler
wind and solar plants can be put up in 2-5 years. As they put it in
[[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.01.005][this paper]] which dissects different metrics used to assess the
relative deployment rates of renewables and nuclear: "Contrary to
persistent myths based on erroneous methods, global data show that
renewable electricity adds output and saves carbon faster than nuclear
power does or ever has."


* Funding

Ben [[https://twitter.com/BNW_Ben/status/999469708179947521][brought up]] that some of our funding was from "Renewable Energy
Investment Strategy of Denmark". This is in fact just the name of a
project which is funded by [[https://innovationsfonden.dk/en][Innovation Fund Denmark]], run by the Danish
government. So if anything, this reflects a bias of the Danish
government for renewables. Nuclear is such a non-issue in Denmark that
fighting climate change is synonymous with renewables. My current
funding comes from Helmholtz, which has a huge [[https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/energy/][funding programme]] for
nuclear (mostly waste management and fusion); I was told it is one
billion euro a year, but I haven't been able to verify that (or check
whether it is total German spending on nuclear research or just
Helmholtz's spending).
